            <p>Railway [Metro] System was built in 2023 by NCL development team, for research in cyber security. Its purpose is to help ICS researchers and instructors test IT/OT attack and defense soluctions and provide a platform for ICS security training and education.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Our idea on creating a digital version of the railway system emulation platform, designed to replicate the operation of multiple trains traversing distinct tracks, each equipped with unique sensor-signal controls. This platform is intended to serve as a valuable resource for cybersecurity researchers, enabling them to demonstrate and assess the impact of various types of IT attackes on operational technology (OT) systems. The platform comprises six primary components(programs):</p>
